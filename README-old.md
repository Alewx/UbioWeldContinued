UbioWeld Unofficial Update for .23
==================

Malkuths Edits to Ubioweld with permissions

Ok guys since I got the permission I will be posting this.  Just for you understand Im not taking this over.  So still using this thread to release this version.  Few issues I have noticed but had no time to Track Down.

1. Yes it works in career mode now.  To unlock you have to research Advrocketry.  Every time you build a new Weld it will end up in this Science (Sandbox ignore this its always available)
2. Once you save it in career you will have to go to Research and unlock the part again (just like adding a new mod to existing tree)
3. Noticed that once you weld something it breaks mods (Some mods don't like to be reloaded which is what This mod does to load the new part config) sorry to say the only way to fix this is to start KSP over again.
4. If your not using any other mods then the reload is not needed.. At least I think.   For sure MCE has to be reloaded and so does Interstellar and Engineer.

Can't think of anything else. Its not perfect, but nothing is skipped in the mod and everything that needed to be is replaced in the code with what was needed.  So Fxemitters actual work now. ;)

Thats it, again i'm not taking over the mod and pretty busy with MCE.  But I figured getting this mod working in .23 is pretty important at least to me. So have fun.. And thanks to Ubiozur for the permission to post it.

Good luck.
